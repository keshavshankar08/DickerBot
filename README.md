*A lightweight ESP32-powered robotics platform for learning sensor integration and control through Python.*

## üìö Background

DickerBot was born out of my love for robotics and a desire to make learning sensor integration more accessible. I noticed that most approaches required diving deep into complex systems like ROS or low-level embedded C ‚Äî which, while powerful, could be overwhelming for beginners just trying to understand the basics.

At the time, I was heavily using the **ESP32** and was consistently impressed by how much you could do with such a cheap and small chip. I saw an opportunity: create a small robot with minimal hardware complexity, but powerful enough to teach core robotics concepts using **Python** and **WebSockets**.

## üí° Introduction

**DickerBot** is a simple robot car built around the ESP32 that sends real-time data (IMU, distance sensor, and camera) to a host machine. The host runs a Python WebSocket server that receives this data and sends control commands back. The focus is on **learning** how to work with sensor data in a higher-level environment without needing to deep-dive into embedded code or install large frameworks.

The inspiration for the robot‚Äôs name and initial design came from my professor, **Dr. Dickerson**, whose Cyber-Physical Systems class used similar hardware ‚Äî but with a deeper focus on embedded systems and C. DickerBot aims to be a *higher-level complement* to that approach.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### PCB Assembly

(coming soon)

### Robot Code

The robot code is split between two ESP32 WROOM microcontrollers:

1. **Communicator** (ESP32-CAM): Handles video streaming and sensor data transmission.
2. **Controller** (ESP32-WROOM): Manages motor control and hardware interactions.

#### Setup Steps

1. **Download Libraries**  
    Get the required libraries from the `Releases` section.

2. **Add to Arduino IDE**  
    Import the libraries via `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...`.

3. **Load Example Code**  
    - **Communicator**: `File > Examples > DickerBotCommunicator > Communicator`
    - **Controller**: `File > Examples > DickerBotController > Controller`

4. **Select Board**  
    Set **ESP32 Dev Module** under `Tools > Board`.

5. **Upload Code**  
    - Flash **Communicator** code to the ESP32-CAM (Ensure you toggle the switch on the module to boot mode).
    - Flash **Controller** code to the ESP32-WROOM.

For detailed documentation, please refer to the [DickerBotCommunicator README](./DickerBotCommunicator/README.md) and [DickerBotController README](./DickerBotController/README.md).

Refer to the demo video below for a step-by-step guide:

(COMING SOON)

### Host Application

The host application is responsible for syncing Wi-Fi credentials and robot data between the computer and the robot. It also manages starting the WebSocket server, hosted on the computer, which allows a Python script to connect and communicate with the robot.

You can download the host application from the `Releases` section of this repository.

Below is an image of the host application's user interface:

#### UI Overview

1. **Device Manager**: Enter and sync your Wi-Fi credentials to a robot connected to your computer via a serial line.
2. **Device Information**: Information about the robot you have synced to.
3. **Socket Manager**: Start and stop the socket and view the connection status.
4. **Socket Information**: Information about the hosting information for the socket.

Refer to the demo video below for a step-by-step guide:

(COMING SOON)

### Client Library

This client library provides an interface for interacting with a socket-based system. It is designed to facilitate seamless communication and data exchange with the DickerBot service. For detailed documentation, please refer to the [DickerBotClient README](./DickerBotClient/README.md).

#### Installation
You can install the library using pip: `pip install dickerbotclient`

Refer to the demo video below for a step-by-step guide:

## Acknowledgements
This project would not have taken shape without the influence of [**Dr. Dickerson**](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/people/faculty/samuel-dickerson/), whose teachings and guidance were instrumental in shaping the ideas behind DickerBot.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- Camera frame rate is currently low (~10 FPS over WebSocket)

## Why DickerBot?

This is a platform for learning, not performance. The goal is to provide a **friendly, hackable entry point** into robotics using affordable hardware and intuitive Python code ‚Äî and hopefully inspire others the same way this project inspired me.
